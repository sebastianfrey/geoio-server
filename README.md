# geoio-server

The content of this repository is a result of the module GIS Programming @ Hochschule MÃ¼nchen in WS2017/18.

The main purpose was to implement an algorithm, which calculates the complex hull of points. In addition a graphical user interface was required, which allows to manually create points.

To achive this goals, web technologies are used:

The client side code is written in JavaScript by using the React+Redux Stack in conjunction with Leaflet, which can be found [here](https://github.com/sebastianfrey/geoio).

The server side code is written in Python using the Flask RESTful Framework, which is represented by this repository.
